# Team-Rays

The aim of this project is to develop an online website for our team.


## Guidelines

Please try to follow these guidelines:

- [ ] Try to make the UI as elegant as possible, use Cards, box-shadows etc. Choose a subtle color-theme.

- [ ] Prefer functional components over class components, use react hooks.

- [ ] Only use images/content that are available for free and don't need any special license.

- [ ] Last but not the least, use your imagination to build the coolest app you can think of ! :heart_eyes_cat: :fire: :fire:

## Setting up the project

1. Clone the repository on your local machine (cloning might take some time).
2. Run npm install.
